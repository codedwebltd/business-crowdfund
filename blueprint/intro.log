  please read

 /home/qiviotalk/business.qiviotalk.online/blueprint/map.MD check what am building... i have globalsettings in my db
  alerady, u can confirm with tinker and migration file. i want to proceed with building the user model here is my model
  pattern php artisan make:model -msf ! but before that u should understand the project by now. weare not in a haste.
  we need to understand that this project is inerita/vue project. also when u analyze my project we will discuss the
  models and migrations needed for the user relationsip. remember that if u write all te columns out here it will bloat
  this chat so we need to discuss..with urintelignce, u should understand  that tis is a professional grade project i
  dont want u to be pastng files u editted or created on this chat please if u must paste it cut it to first 10 line.. u
  should use ur professional knowledge to know every column based on ur understanding of the project.  also we detect
  country by using the jenssegers/agent u can access /home/qiviotalk/public_html/app/Traits/LocationTrait.php if u ant
  to understad dhow locaton works ,  

  this path is where u can also copy the location database file in public_path and paste in the 
  public_path of our working directory  wihich is above.

  make sure the coutry code is attached to number as we will save it in db with country code to enable us not to have 
  unforseen issue with sms apis..
  
  we wil start by creatin traits and services of many things because when this 
  project bloats it will be hard to maintain

avoid hard-code / static coding of certain features instead use traits and services to handle those features
  
  
i will need a clean redesign of the registeration.vue andlogin.vue to be very unqiue from what it is right now
i need u to give me industry standrd deign not plain like it i sright now remove the div block on that header that has the heading on both files
replace them with sweet design that will make the project look very proffesional currently is childish. dont u see  lets do this design first before we proceed.
