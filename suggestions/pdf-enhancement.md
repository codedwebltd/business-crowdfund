Add a subtle background watermark pattern (SVG tiled)

Add QR code (referral)

Add light/dark brand variants but in a way it wont break in email apps or affects texts or design  visibility

make sure all the figures on each pdf are dynamic e.g get 20% on..... the 20 percent is static, migt not show us exactly what we have in $settings-> oon the long run which is lack of trust from users. also same applies to the structure of information e.g when u wrote (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Diamond) and unlock:</p> 
this arent going to matc with actual plans so in this case they can be referred to as example: (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Diamond) and unlock: for educational purpose.not actual plan name so u need to be careful with all the emails no spac for error this script will serve  10k+ people in the country

even the pedning balance maturing in 72hrs thats a static info not dynamic thats wy we ave an excllent globalsettings which u can expose to the view using appserviceprovider that settings can be available to all views for easy acess. or app(container injection.)

that first withdrawal  requirements : is kinda tricky, replace it with another fancy sweet non scary rwquirements because telling users that testimonial is a requirement is kkinda tricky and might get unpredicatable reactions.

each time user registers we will track count in admin globalsettings e.g $settings->total_memebers = 20; it will be better than counting all users from user model so that i will be able to add to the count if i wish.  then where u wrote 10,000+ earners can now be Number::abreviate($settings->total_memebers) you understad?? on user delete, the colun should $settings->decrement(total_memebers)

dont forget to sign our signature on the field meant for us to sign on the pdf then the users signature should be their abbreviation with a line slash. since they read terms and accept from register ui they have agreed to the terms of our service so we sign for them. that will hold a legal justice against them tomorrow.

we need to add date of birth on the registeration then add column and model fillable in our classes dont worry we will do migrate fresh later so everything will sync this will ensure that the users are 18yrs of age if date of birth is less than 18, we tell them a toast error that this service is meant for people older exactly 18yrs of age. only that no banning them from cntinuing. just the alert message

in the terms and condition pdf, u need to specify not just bank details but also mention crypto because basically we will use it. the bank will be disabeld from admin till i decide on turningiton.  this agreement should be cour ready for defending the system.

you stated plan names at some point. please no statign of static plans thats false info.
System approval not admin. dont use admin use system keyword in all places even in other pdfs just searc and replace all it sounds more professional than admin

the task reward are held for .... should get the exact time from globalsettings. please always trust global settig for vital info

in userwallet we need to add total_deposited_balabce if we dont have it. so users can track teir total deposits. so far in teir dashboard.

also don forget that we need to have withdrawal_rate if not included yet in $settings->withdrawal_rate that will ensure that in the user dashboard when we build the noticeboard system, users can also see when their is  fluctuation in withdrawal, that will force intending withdrawees to back off and wait for green days ( which is wait to see a better rate giving platform chance to breathe) this proces doont need to be explained in the terms it is internal logic.

whenever there is change n rate it will be announced globaly!! in all notifications channel. wehavent gotten to this level yet but so u know.
so kindy change that test u write in the terms the lin that says commision rate: remove that sustanability because it is tricky, and might send negative message to the masses
